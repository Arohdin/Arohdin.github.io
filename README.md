## Vocalinator
This is a top-down shooter game made in JavaScript, (alot) more info can be found at: https://github.com/Arohdin/Vocalinator

## Random Particles
Random particles that fly around on the screen; some user interaction.
Something I threw together due to boredom. Could be optimized and used as an 'background'-element on a website.
You can check it out at: http://arohdin.github.io/particle/
